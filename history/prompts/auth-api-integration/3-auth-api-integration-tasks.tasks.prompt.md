# Prompt

```
"specs/auth-api-integration"
```

# Response

Generated comprehensive task list for Authentication & API integration feature based on design documents. Created 40+ tasks organized by user story with proper dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. Tasks cover:

- Phase 1: Setup (project initialization)
- Phase 2: Foundational (blocking prerequisites)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 (registration and authentication)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 (todo management with auth)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 (session management)
- Phase 6: Polish & cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required format with IDs, story labels, and file paths.

# Outcome

Task list is complete and ready for implementation. All user stories are organized to be independently testable with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified.
